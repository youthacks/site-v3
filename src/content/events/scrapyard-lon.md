We were super excited to run Scrapyard London, an all-day hackathon, in March 2025. This was held at tldraw's HQ in Cambridge, UK.
Teams of teenagers worked together over around 8 hours to make the 'scrappiest projects' they could - silly, wacky, whatever they can dream of.

This was part of Scrapyard, a global event run by Hack Club, with teens in 60+ cities worldwide all taking part in one weekend
