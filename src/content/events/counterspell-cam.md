We were super excited to run Counterspell Cambridge, an all-day game jam, in September 2024. This was held at Raspberry Pi HQ in Cambridge, UK.

Teams of teenagers worked together over around 8 hours to make new and interesting games, which were then shared with and voted on by everyone who took part.
While this is not a lot of time to make a full game (we know), we were still blown away by what everyone managed to create!

This was part of Counterspell, a global event run by Hack Club, with teens in 50+ cities worldwide all taking part in one weekend.
