We were super excited to run Cool as Hack, an all-day hackathon with Raspberry Pi, in April 2025. This was our first event organised completely by us, and was held at Raspberry Pi HQ in Cambridge, UK.

Teams of teenagers worked together over around 8 hours to make new and interesting projects, which they could then submit to Coolest Projects, an annual global competition for young people to make.
We had a fantastic time seeing everyone's creativity!
