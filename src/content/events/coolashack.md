We were super excited to run Cool as Hack, an all-day hackathon, in April 2025. This was our first event organised completely by us, and was held at Raspberry Pi Foundation HQ in Cambridge, UK.

Teams of teenagers worked together over 12 hours to make new and interesting projects, which they could then submit to Coolest Projects, an annual global showcase run by Raspberry Pi where young people can share their ideas with the world. We had a fantastic time seeing everyone's creativity!
