## 🚀 Contribute

This website is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for some interactive parts.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Content

Each event has its own file in `content/events/`. If there's a new event, just copy an existing one and change it up a bit - usually that's all you need to do 🙃

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
