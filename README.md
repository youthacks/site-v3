# Youthacks website

This is the (hopefully to-be) website for Youthacks. We support and run student-led hackathons.

This website is made with [Astro](https://astro.build), with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for some interactive parts.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev

### Content

Each event has its own file in `content/events/`. If there's a new event, just copy an existing one and change it up a bit - usually that's all you need to do ðŸ™ƒ

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
